# hackup - simple iOS console application

hackup is a sample app, it lists bundle identifiers of all installed applications.

If you pass a single argument - a bundle id - to hackup, it will try to launch corresponding app via [libdisplaystack](https://github.com/Zimm/libdisplaystack) (it should be installed from Cydia).
